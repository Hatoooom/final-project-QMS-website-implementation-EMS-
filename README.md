## 🔭 Project Overview

The **EMS ISO-CMD** system is a web-based simulation of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Unlike simple tracking apps, this system implements a strict **Quality Management System (QMS)**. It focuses on the critical balance between operational speed and asset safety.

The system integrates:
* **Command & Control (C2):** Real-time visualization of assets.
* **Logistics:** Tracking of critical medical supplies.
* **Auditability:** Immutable logging of incident timestamps.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🗺️ Command Map:** A geospatial dashboard showing "Single Source of Truth" for all units.
* **🚑 Fleet Readiness Logic:** Monitors Fuel, Health, and Supply levels dynamically.
* **⏱️ Precision Logging:** Records $T_0$ (Call), $T_1$ (Dispatch), $T_2$ (Arrival), and $T_3$ (Return).
* **🛡️ Automated QMS Gate:** prevents the dispatch of unsafe vehicles (e.g., low fuel or damaged hull), ensuring adherence to **ISO 22320** safety protocols.
